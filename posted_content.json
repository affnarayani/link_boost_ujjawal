    "title": "Arms Act, 1959: Renewal is the Norm, Refusal the Exception, Rules Madras High Court",
    "description": "<p>The Madras High Court, in a significant ruling by its Madurai Bench, has clarified that while possessing a firearm is a regulated privilege under the Arms Act, 1959, the renewal of an existing licence, especially after peaceful use, should be considered the norm. Refusal of renewal, the Court asserted, must be based on explicit, rational, and case-specific findings, shifting the burden from the applicant to the licensing authority to provide compelling reasons.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment arose from a petition filed by Magudapathi, an ordinary citizen who held a smooth bore gun licence since 2021 for crop protection and sport, which had been routinely renewed once. His application for a second renewal in 2024 was denied by the District Magistrate cum District Collector, Dindigul, solely on the grounds that Magudapathi was facing prosecution under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code for a fatal motor vehicle accident. The Collector deemed this a threat to \"public safety,\" prompting Magudapathi to challenge the decision in the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>Justice G.R. Swaminathan, examining Sections 13, 14, and 15 of the Arms Act, 1959, highlighted Section 15(3), which mandates that a licence \"shall, unless the licensing authority for reasons to be recorded in writing otherwise decides, be renewable.\" The Court emphasized that this provision converts the initial privilege into an expectancy of renewal, which can only be defeated by reasons that meet the standards of Section 14, pertaining to refusal. The High Court found the Collector's justification \"woefully insufficient,\" stating that a prosecution for negligent driving (Section 304A IPC) is distinct from firearm-related misconduct, nor does it indicate an individual is of unsound mind or unfit as per Section 14. Furthermore, the Court reiterated that while alternative remedies exist, it can intervene via writ jurisdiction when an impugned order is patently illegal.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the High Court quashed the Collector's order and directed the renewal of Magudapathi’s gun licence for five years, subject to standard conditions. This ruling serves as a crucial reminder that administrative discretion in weapon licensing tightens once a citizen has demonstrated trustworthy conduct, safeguarding individual expectation and ensuring a principled application of the Arms Act against arbitrary denials based on unrelated criminal proceedings.</p>",

    "title": "Rajasthan HC: Assignment under section 5 SARFAESI survives even if NPA tag quashed, guarantors can’t reopen decade-old ARC deal.",
    "description": "<p>The Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur Bench, recently delivered a significant ruling affirming that a debt assignment under Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, maintains its validity even if the Non-Performing Asset (NPA) classification, which triggered subsequent enforcement actions, is later quashed. In Harendra Singh Rathore & Ors. v. State Bank of India & Ors., Justice Rekha Borana refused to undo a 2014 debt assignment by SBI to Alchemist Assets Reconstruction Co., emphasizing that invalidating the NPA tag affects only Section 13 enforcement actions, not the independent prior sale of the loan under Section 5.</p>\n\n<p>This decade-long legal battle originated from a ₹24 crore debt incurred by Hotel Gaudavan Pvt. Ltd. in 2008, guaranteed by its director-shareholders. After the account became an NPA and was put up for sale, SBI assigned the debt to Alchemist ARC in 2014. Despite borrowers' attempts to challenge the proceedings through various forums, including a DRT ruling in 2015 that declared the original NPA classification illegal, the debt's ownership remained with the ARC. The guarantors subsequently sought to declare the 2014 assignment void, arguing that the quashing of the NPA rendered all subsequent actions, including the assignment, invalid.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court dismissed the guarantors' petition, primarily citing the principle of res judicata, as identical pleas had been rejected multiple times by various judicial bodies, up to the Supreme Court. The court reiterated that while Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act requires an NPA declaration for enforcement, Section 5, which deals with the transfer of financial assets, does not. Therefore, the 2015 DRT order invalidating the NPA only impacted possession proceedings, not the earlier, distinct assignment deed. Relying on the Supreme Court's ICICI Bank v. Official Liquidator of APS Star Industries judgment, the court affirmed that a debt is an asset transferable by a bank without borrower consent, irrespective of the NPA tag's correctness. The court also noted the availability of alternative statutory remedies for challenging recovery orders.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling provides crucial clarity and reassurance for lenders and Asset Reconstruction Companies. It firmly establishes that a bank's right to assign its loan under Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act is an independent power, not contingent on the ultimate fate of its internal NPA classification or the successful execution of Section 13 enforcement measures. Once a debt is assigned, courts will generally uphold the finality of that contract, strengthening the framework for managing and resolving bad assets within the financial system.</p>",

    "title": "IBC and Homebuyers Protection",
    "description": "<p>The article details the evolving landscape of homebuyers' rights under India's Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). A pivotal 2018 amendment recognized real estate allottees as financial creditors, granting them participation and voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) during Corporate Insolvency Resolution Processes (CIRP). This move followed significant protests by homebuyers, who were initially excluded from meaningful engagement, leading to earlier regulatory adjustments by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to facilitate their claims. Courts have consistently held that delays in property handover constitute a default under the IBC, necessitating developers to either deliver or return funds.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this progress, the Supreme Court's validation of the 2018 amendment in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. v. Union of India (2019) categorized homebuyers as unsecured creditors. This classification has been criticized for limiting their recovery prospects and decision-making power in comparison to secured financial institutions, which typically dominate the CoC. Practical administration reveals ongoing inequities, including the exclusion of homebuyers who fail to file claims on time and a significant disparity in interest rates, with homebuyers receiving a capped 8% per annum while lenders impose much higher rates. Regulatory measures, such as IBBI's Regulation 4-E, further empower project lenders by requiring substantial CoC approval for possession, potentially exacerbating homebuyer suppression.</p>\n\n<p>The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), 2016, complements the IBC by mandating transparency, timely project completion, and offering recourse for delays. However, a deeper integration of these frameworks is needed. Legal scholarship and emerging jurisprudence advocate for elevating homebuyers to secured creditor status, citing their proprietary interest in specific flats and the statutory debt arising from non-delivery under RERA. While innovative judicial solutions like 'Reverse CIRP' have emerged to protect possession rights, a definitive consensus on granting homebuyers secured status remains elusive.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends from 2023-2025 indicate some positive shifts, with the Supreme Court acknowledging verified claims for flat possession and urging the inclusion of unfiled but recorded claims. Nevertheless, systemic challenges persist, fueled by fragmented homebuyer groups, procedural complexities, opaque valuations, and the financial dominance of project lenders. Comprehensive reforms are crucial, including enhancing homebuyers' voting power, legally recognizing their secured status, equalizing interest rates, and empowering regulators to enforce transparency and penalize malfeasance, ultimately ensuring homebuyers' constitutional right to shelter is effectively upheld within the insolvency framework.</p>",

    "title": "Orissa HC slams Cuttack bank for holding back gratuity over a loan guarantee—reaffirms Section 4(6) is the only key to forfeit gratuity dues.",
    "description": "<p>The Orissa High Court, in a Division Bench ruling on September 20, 2025, emphatically reiterated that gratuity can only be forfeited under the precise conditions stipulated in Section 4(6) of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The court admonished the Cuttack Central Cooperative Bank Ltd. for unlawfully withholding a retired employee's gratuity over her role as a personal guarantor for a defaulted loan, underscoring that superannuation does not permit such set-offs.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when a Deputy Manager, who retired in 2010 after superannuation with an unblemished record, was denied her gratuity. The bank justified its action by citing her liability as a guarantor for a loan that later went unpaid. This decision was consistently overturned by the Controlling Authority, the Appellate Authority, and a Single Bench of the Orissa High Court before reaching the Division Bench as a writ appeal.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court dismissed the bank's appeal, emphasizing that Section 4(6) of the Act, which begins with a non-obstante clause, permits forfeiture only to the extent of damage or loss suffered by the employer if the employee was \"terminated\" for a wilful act, omission, or negligence causing such damage. Retirement on superannuation, the court clarified, is the antithesis of termination for misconduct, thus eliminating the statutory trigger for forfeiture. The court further held that introducing a guarantor's civil liability into the Act would constitute an unauthorized judicial expansion of its scope, reinforcing that gratuity is a statutory right earned through service, not a security deposit for credit.</p>\n\n<p>Concluding that three statutory forums had already reached the same conclusion without perversity, irrationality, or exceeding statutory remit, the court found no grounds for interference. This judgment serves as a critical reminder to all employers that the provisions of Section 4(6) of the 1972 Act are the sole gateway for gratuity forfeiture, strictly limited to proven misconduct and not extendable to civil liabilities like loan guarantees. The bank was consequently ordered to release the gratuity forthwith.</p>",
