    "title": "ISO vs AOAC vs BIS: How the Latest FSSAI Amendment Will Speed Up Food Imports",
    "description": "<p>The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has introduced significant amendments to its import regulations with the publication of the Food Safety and Standards (Import) First Amendment Regulations, 2025, effective from May 1, 2026. This update aims to streamline India's food import clearance process by accelerating procedures and enhancing scientific adaptability, following a year-long consultative process.</p>\n\n<p>A key revision under Regulation 10(4)(b) addresses analytical testing methods. Previously, laboratories were restricted to FSSAI-issued analytical manuals. The amendment now allows laboratories to adopt any internationally accepted, validated method—such as AOAC, ISO, BIS, or Codex Alimentarius—if a specific testing parameter is not covered by FSSAI manuals. This change resolves a prior regulatory gap that often led to testing delays or the need for case-by-case dispensations.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a critical new provision, sub-regulation 10(5), imposes a statutory timeline for analytical reports. From May 2026, all notified or referral laboratories must issue their findings in Form-2 within five calendar days of receiving a sample. This mandate, coupled with the expanded scope for testing methods, is expected to significantly shorten the average import clearance window and reduce demurrage costs for importers.</p>\n\n<p>Collectively, these amendments represent a modernization of India's food-safety architecture. By embracing globally recognized test methods and enforcing strict reporting timelines, FSSAI has achieved a balance between scientific rigor and trade facilitation, benefiting both consumer advocates and stakeholders in the food supply chain without compromising safety standards.</p>",

    "title": "No Toll for Police Help: Rajasthan HC Blocks Magistrate Bid to Load SARFAESI Section 14 With Pre-Deposit",
    "description": "<p>The Rajasthan High Court has delivered a significant ruling, setting aside a Chief Judicial Magistrate's (CJM) order that demanded a pre-deposit for police assistance under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002. This decision prevents the introduction of an arbitrary financial hurdle into a summary remedy intended for speedy enforcement, clarifying that state assistance for securing physical possession is an enforcement obligation, not a chargeable service.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose when Tyger Home Finance Pvt. Ltd., after taking symbolic possession of a defaulted property in Alwar, sought the CJM's aid for physical possession with police support. The CJM, Alwar, issued the possession order but made it contingent on the financier depositing ₹6.34 lakh towards \"police expenses.\" This amount was deemed disproportionate to the outstanding loan and lacked any statutory backing or precedent, prompting the financier to challenge the condition before the Rajasthan High Court.</p>\n\n<p>Counsel for Tyger Home Finance argued that Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act is a remedial provision aimed at swift recovery, and it does not authorize secured creditors to pre-finance state machinery. They cited previous rulings that struck down similar deposit requirements. The State contended that the condition was pragmatic due to logistical costs but failed to provide statutory justification. Justice Ashutosh Kumar of the High Court unequivocally stated that \"there is no provision under Section 14 of the Act of 2002 which may authorize the learned Magistrate to direct the secured creditor to deposit any expenses of police assistance.\" The Court underscored that a Magistrate's duty, once satisfied with a lender's entitlement, is to facilitate enforcement without imposing financial gates, which would frustrate the Act's summary purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the impugned condition in the CJM's order was set aside. The High Court directed Tyger Home Finance to approach the police directly and instructed the police authorities to comply with the original possession order \"at the earliest\" without insisting on any deposit. This judgment reinforces the critical principle that summary statutory remedies must remain free from extraneous pre-conditions, ensuring that Section 14 serves its intended purpose as a facilitator for lenders and not a mechanism for generating revenue from state services. It establishes a clear precedent that police assistance under Section 14 is an inherent part of the State's enforcement obligation.</p>",

    "title": "CKYC Opens Digital Doors: New Relief for Differently-Abled Customers",
    "description": "<p>The Central KYC Records Registry (CKYCRR) announced a significant policy change on October 31, 2025, aimed at improving digital banking accessibility for millions of differently-abled individuals in India. This circular, effective November 14, 2025, makes three previously mandatory data fields optional for customers who identify as differently abled across banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, and fintech entities.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, differently-abled applicants were required to provide their exact medical impairment label, the precise percentage assigned by a certifying authority, and their Unique Disability ID (UDID) to complete digital onboarding. This stringent requirement created substantial barriers, forcing many to abandon digital channels due to missing UDIDs, outdated certificates, or a reluctance to disclose sensitive medical information, thereby defeating the objective of financial inclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Responding to regulatory feedback, CKYCRR has reclassified these three fields as optional. While institutions must still display these boxes in their interfaces, users can now leave them blank. The only remaining mandatory data point is a simple \"yes/no\" question confirming if the customer is differently abled, which allows for continued tracking of inclusion metrics without impeding the workflow. This adjustment signifies a crucial step towards reducing friction in digital financial services, allowing differently-abled individuals to open investment and other accounts with greater ease and dignity.</p>",

    "title": "Broken Assurances, Coerced Payments: Consumer Commission Fines IndiGo for Deficiency in Service",
    "description": "<p>The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Ernakulam, has issued a significant ruling against IndiGo Airlines, fining it for deficiency in service and unfair trade practices. This decision stems from a complaint filed by Mr. T.P. Salim Kumar, an IRS officer, who was wrongfully deboarded from his flight, subjected to broken assurances, and later publicly humiliated into making a coerced payment for services he was promised would be free.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Kumar was deboarded due to an \"operational/technical issue\" and was promised a full refund, a confirmed seat on an earlier connecting flight, and complimentary rest and food facilities. IndiGo failed to honor these commitments; his rebooked flight was much later, and while he was directed to an airport lounge with assurances that all expenses would be covered, he was subsequently compelled to pay ₹2,150 for food and a beer under duress, facing public embarrassment and a threat of being denied boarding. IndiGo's subsequent offers of inadequate compensation were refused.</p>\n\n<p>IndiGo contested the complaint on procedural grounds, arguing misjoinder and lack of territorial jurisdiction based on a forum-selection clause. Substantively, the airline admitted offloading due to \"seat-availability constraint,\" claimed the lounge access was a \"goodwill gesture,\" and asserted that alcoholic beverages were \"expressly excluded\" from complimentary services, justifying the charge. However, the Commission dismissed IndiGo's procedural objections as \"hyper-technical,\" affirming Ernakulam's jurisdiction under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which supersedes one-sided contractual clauses.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, the Commission found IndiGo's assurances regarding the connecting flight and lounge expenses to be \"uncontroverted.\" Applying the contra proferentem rule, it determined that IndiGo failed to prove any communication about the exclusion of alcoholic beverages, concluding that forcing the passenger to pay under threat of denied boarding constituted a clear \"deficiency in service\" and an \"unfair trade practice.\" Consequently, the Commission ordered IndiGo to refund the coerced ₹2,150 lounge payment and ₹626 for missed movie tickets, both with 9% annual interest. Additionally, IndiGo was directed to pay ₹1,00,000 as compensation for mental agony and inconvenience, and ₹20,000 towards the cost of proceedings, to be paid within 45 days.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment reinforces consumer rights, serving as a vital reminder to service providers, particularly airlines, that their responsibilities extend beyond mere technical compliance. The ruling underscores that statutory remedies under consumer protection laws cannot be circumvented by ambiguous contractual terms or \"hyper-technical\" defenses, thereby upholding passenger dignity and the \"relationship of trust\" inherent in air travel.</p>",

    "title": "Won the Battle, Must Win the War: Rajasthan High Court Enforces United Kingdom GAFTA Award",
    "description": "<p>The Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur has ordered the enforcement of a London-seated GAFTA (Grain and Feed Trade Association) appeal award, effectively converting it into a decree of the Court. This judgment concludes a seven-year dispute involving an Austrian company, Kingsroad Handelsgesellschaft m.b.H., and an Indian entity, Raj Grow Impex LLP, over three container-loads of yellow peas. The ruling is significant for its reaffirmation of the narrow interpretation Indian courts apply to the \"public policy\" defense against foreign award enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute originated from three back-to-back contracts in September 2018 for Russian-origin yellow peas, brokered with a standard GAFTA arbitration clause. Following contentious issues over price, demurrage, and container free-time, Kingsroad initiated arbitration in London. The first-tier GAFTA tribunal upheld Kingsroad's claim in August 2020, a decision confirmed by the GAFTA Board of Appeal in September 2021. Raj Grow failed to challenge or set aside the award within the stipulated 28-day window in England.</p>\n\n<p>Subsequently, Kingsroad petitioned the Rajasthan High Court for the award's enforcement as a decree, execution against Raj Grow's assets, and costs. Raj Grow resisted enforcement, citing \"patent illegality\" and \"violation of Indian public policy.\" Their primary contention was that Kingsroad's direct payment of container detention charges to shipping lines outside India deprived Raj Grow of input GST credit, leading to revenue loss for the Indian government and thus offending fundamental Indian law, national interest, and morality.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand, noting Raj Grow's prior inaction in the arbitration proceedings and abroad, emphasized that Section 48 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, mandates a skeletal inquiry, precluding a review of merits or re-appreciation of evidence. Drawing upon Supreme Court precedents like Vedanta, Avitel Post Studioz, and Shri Lal Mahal, the Court reiterated that \"public policy\" must be construed narrowly, limited to violations of fundamental Indian law, national interest, or basic notions of justice/morality. The Court found that a grievance regarding GST leakage, even if true, constituted a contractual accounting dispute already adjudicated, which neither shocked the conscience nor struck at the root of India's economic order, thus not meeting the stringent public policy threshold.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the GAFTA Appeal Award was declared enforceable and converted into a decree of the Rajasthan High Court. Raj Grow has been directed to disclose all its assets within six weeks for execution proceedings, while Kingsroad is free to pursue attachment and sale. This judgment strongly reinforces India's pro-enforcement stance towards foreign arbitral awards, limiting merit-based objections and providing greater assurance to international award holders seeking realization of their claims in India.</p>",

    "title": "Medical Devices Step Out of Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Shadow: 2025 Amendment Ends Labelling Confusion",
    "description": "<p>The Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Amendment Rules, 2025 has significantly revised the regulatory framework for medical device packaging, effectively exempting these products from the general consumer packaging regulations. This amendment, enacted under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009, resolves a decade-long conflict and overlap between the Legal Metrology rules and the specialized Medical Devices Rules, 2017 (under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation - CDSCO).</p>\n\n<p>The Central Government utilized its power to exempt specific package classes, making the Medical Devices Rules, 2017 the exclusive authority for all labelling declarations on medical device packages. This change is integrated by amending Rule 2(h) of the 2011 Packaged Commodities Rules, which now specifically carves out \"packages containing medical devices\" from the definition of a \"pre-packaged commodity.\" Consequently, previous requirements for precise typographic measurements (Rules 7(2) and 7(3)) are no longer applicable; instead, the 2017 Rules' focus on legibility and contrast will govern. Furthermore, Rule 33 clarifies that no Legal Metrology waivers or concessions apply where the Medical Devices Rules, 2017 are in effect, solidifying the medical device regime as the sole compliance pathway.</p>\n\n<p>This amendment addresses a history of jurisdictional confusion, conflicting court rulings, and operational burdens on manufacturers who previously had to comply with two distinct regulatory bodies. The operational impact for manufacturers is immediate, promising shorter artwork cycles, elimination of redundant dual-language stickers, and faster import clearances. For consumers, essential safeguards on safety, performance, and traceability remain intact, with the enforcement authority now solely under CDSCO. This regulatory adjustment represents a strategic \"de-harmonisation through harmonisation,\" aligning medical devices under a single, more specialized legal framework.</p>",

    "title": "Registrar Has No Statutory Authority to Issue NOC for Redevelopment, Rules Bombay High Court",
    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court has issued a significant ruling, asserting that the Registrar of Cooperative Societies lacks the statutory authority to issue a \"No Objection Certificate\" (NOC) for the redevelopment of cooperative housing societies. This judgment, delivered by Justice Amit Borkar, clarifies that such approvals have no legal basis under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, or its associated Rules, 1961. The Court unequivocally stated that the General Body of a cooperative housing society remains the ultimate and supreme authority for all redevelopment decisions, provided procedural compliance and transparency are maintained.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling stemmed from a challenge to an NOC granted by a District Deputy Registrar. The Court found no legal provision empowering the Registrar to approve or reject redevelopment decisions, deeming any such issuance ultra vires. Instead, the Court clarified that the Registrar's role, as per the Government Resolution dated 4 July 2019, is strictly supervisory. This involves nominating an Authorised Officer to attend Special General Meetings (SGMs) for developer selection, ensuring quorum, fair voting, and proper record-keeping, without exercising any power to veto or modify the society's decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, any NOC previously issued by the Registrar for redevelopment is legally invalid, and decisions lawfully made by the society's General Body remain enforceable. Justice Borkar directed all Registrars across the State to refrain from issuing or insisting upon such NOCs and mandated the Commissioner of Cooperation and the Principal Secretary, Cooperation Department, to issue a departmental circular reiterating these directives. Societies are still required to follow prescribed safeguards, including requesting an Authorised Officer and maintaining proper documentation for transparency.</p>\n\n<p>This landmark judgment significantly enhances the autonomy of cooperative housing societies, streamlines redevelopment processes by removing unnecessary administrative hurdles, and reinforces the General Body's decision-making authority. It is expected to foster faster, fairer, and more transparent redevelopment projects throughout Maharashtra by clearly defining the Registrar's role as purely supervisory rather than one of control or approval.</p>",

This significant corporate reorganization aligns with Unilever PLC's global strategy to separate its ice cream operations, positioning KWIL as an independent business entity.</p>\n\n<p>HUL's Ice Cream Business, which includes popular brands such as Kwality Wall’s, Cornetto, and Magnum, will now operate under KWIL. This move aims to provide focused management, tailored strategy, and greater flexibility for the ice cream division to pursue market opportunities independently. The scheme ensures continuity of shareholder value by granting HUL shareholders one KWIL share for every HUL share held, maintaining a 1:1 entitlement ratio.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLT approved the scheme after extensive review, confirming it was fair, reasonable, and fully compliant with all statutory and regulatory requirements. All necessary approvals from regulatory bodies, including SEBI, BSE, and NSE, were secured, and no objections were raised by stakeholders or authorities. The Tribunal affirmed that the demerger would benefit all stakeholders without prejudicing the interests of creditors or employees.</p>\n\n<p>This landmark demerger marks a strategic milestone for HUL. It paves the way for Kwality Wall’s (India) Limited to pursue focused growth in the frozen desserts and ice cream segment as a dedicated and independent company within the Unilever group in India. Concurrently, it allows HUL to consolidate resources and strategic efforts on its core fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) portfolio, thereby enhancing overall value creation and operational efficiency. The NCLT's sanction underscores its role in facilitating transparent and compliant business realignments.</p>",

    "title": "When Banking on Fraud-Reporting Backfires: Delhi HC Quashes Criminal Defamation Case Against Bank CEOs",
    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court recently quashed a criminal defamation complaint filed by Rangoli International Pvt. Ltd. against the Managing Directors and senior officials of four public-sector banks. The company had accused the bankers of \"malicious slander\" after its ₹250-crore loan account was classified as \"fraud\" and reported on the RBI/CRILC portal. Justice Neena Bansal Krishna ruled in favor of the banks, emphasizing that classifying an account as fraud, when based on central-agency requests and internal investigations, does not constitute defamation.</p>\n\n<p>The genesis of the dispute was Rangoli International's consortium facility, which became a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) by March 2015. A CBI raid on Rangoli's premises in 2014, though not resulting in a charge-sheet against the company, prompted a forensic audit by the lenders. Following inconclusive audit reports, but concurrent letters from the CBI and RBI directing banks to examine the account for fraudulent activity, the banks conducted internal re-examinations. Discovering discrepancies such as bogus airway bills, the banks, adhering to RBI Master Directions on Fraud Classification, independently declared the account \"fraud\" and uploaded this status to the CRILC/FGM portal.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court's decision was anchored on several pivotal arguments. Firstly, it affirmed that the banks were discharging a statutory duty by reporting fraud as requested by regulatory bodies, thereby protected by Exception 9 to Section 499 IPC, which safeguards good-faith accusations made to lawful authorities. The publication was limited to regulatory portals, mitigating any intent to harm reputation. Secondly, the Court reiterated that a company, being a juristic person, inherently lacks the mens rea (criminal intent) essential for defamation under Sections 499/500 IPC. Moreover, vicarious criminal liability cannot be imposed on officers without an explicit statutory provision, which is absent in the IPC for defamation. The complaint also failed to demonstrate personal involvement or malicious intent from individual officials. Finally, the absence of prior sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C. for public servants was noted, and the complaint itself was deemed an abuse of process aimed at coercing the banks.</p>\n\n<p>This landmark judgment provides crucial clarity, underscoring that reputational grievances cannot be escalated into criminal defamation without concrete proof of personal criminal intent. By reaffirming the mens rea barrier for juristic persons and highlighting the necessity of explicit vicarious liability provisions, the Delhi High Court has reinforced good-faith compliance by financial institutions against potential penal litigation. The ruling empowers lenders to adhere to mandatory and time-bound fraud reporting guidelines without the apprehension of unwarranted criminal charges.</p>",

    "title": "Pay First, Recover Later: SC Reiterates Humanitarian Approach in Motor Accident Compensation",
    "description": "<p>In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court of India, in K. Nagendra v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd., reaffirmed the victim-centric principle in motor accident compensation, holding that an insurer cannot deny compensation to accident victims due to technical policy breaches, such as a vehicle operating beyond its sanctioned route permit. This decision underscores the social justice intent of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, positioning motor insurance as a public welfare instrument rather than merely a private contract. The core of the judgment relies on the \"pay and recover\" doctrine, ensuring immediate compensation for victims while preserving the insurer's right to seek recovery from the vehicle owner for proven contractual violations.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a fatal motor accident involving a bus, owned by K. Nagendra and insured by New India Assurance Co. Ltd., which was allegedly plying outside its permitted route. While the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal awarded compensation, the insurer challenged it, citing a fundamental breach of policy conditions. The central legal question before the Apex Court was whether a route permit violation absolves the insurer from third-party liability or if it must still compensate victims before seeking recovery from the vehicle owner.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphatically stated that an insurer cannot escape liability to third parties solely because the vehicle operated outside its sanctioned route. It emphasized that the essence of compulsory insurance under the Motor Vehicles Act is to prevent victims from being left uncompensated due to technical defaults. The Court reiterated the \"pay and recover\" mechanism, directing the insurer to first disburse compensation to the victims and then recover the amount from the vehicle owner if the policy breach is established. This approach judiciously balances the protection of third-party rights with the insurer's contractual interests. While prioritizing victim compensation, the Court also clarified that the insurer's obligations are not unlimited, respecting contractual boundaries where liability clearly falls outside the agreed framework.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, directing New India Assurance Co. Ltd. to pay the awarded compensation to the victims' dependents and subsequently recover the sum from the vehicle owner, K. Nagendra. This judgment reinforces the imperative of prompt compensation for accident victims, regardless of technical infractions, while also ensuring contractual accountability for vehicle owners who violate permit conditions. The ruling solidifies the integrity of India's motor accident compensation system by embodying both judicial empathy for victims and fairness for insurers.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in The Commissioner, Trade and Tax, Delhi v. M/s Shanti Kiran India (P) Ltd., has decisively reaffirmed protection for bona fide purchasing dealers under the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 (DVAT Act). The Court dismissed the Department's appeals, upholding the Delhi High Court's stance that Input Tax Credit (ITC) cannot be denied to genuine purchasers solely because the selling dealer, despite being registered at the time of transaction, subsequently defaulted on depositing the collected tax with the government. This ruling carries binding legal significance, reinforcing established interpretations and safeguarding genuine business transactions.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute originated from the Department's denial of ITC to purchasing dealers, including M/s Shanti Kiran India (P) Ltd., who had bought goods from validly registered sellers, paid VAT, and possessed proper tax invoices. The Department argued that since the selling dealers later had their registrations cancelled and failed to remit the collected VAT to the treasury, the corresponding ITC claimed by the purchasers was inadmissible.</p>\n\n<p>The Delhi High Court had previously \"read down\" Section 9(2)(g) of the DVAT Act, which stated that ITC would not be allowed if the tax payable by the selling dealer had not been deposited. The High Court reasoned that this provision should not penalize bona fide purchasing dealers acting in good faith without collusion or fraud. It emphasized that the Department's remedy lies against the defaulting seller, not the innocent buyer, to avoid rendering the provision arbitrary and unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court concurred, finding no reason to interfere with the Delhi High Court's judgment. It observed that denying ITC in such circumstances would be unjustified, especially given its earlier confirmation of similar High Court reasoning. The Court concluded that the appeals lacked merit, thereby upholding the right of bona fide dealers to claim ITC.</p>\n\n<p>This concise yet impactful order holds substantial jurisprudential value. It clarifies the scope of Section 9(2)(g), ensuring that honest taxpayers are protected from the defaults of their sellers, provided they have conducted genuine transactions with registered dealers and possess valid documentation. The ruling aligns with broader principles of \"buyer protection\" seen in other indirect tax regimes, such as GST, strengthening the continuity of judicial thought favouring equity, proportionality, and constitutional fairness in tax administration. For businesses, it provides crucial clarity and reassurance that compliance obligations will not extend beyond what is reasonable and just.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in the case of EPC Constructions India Limited (Through Its Liquidator) v. Matix Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited, has definitively ruled that holders of Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares (CRPS) are not to be treated as financial creditors under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC). This landmark decision reinforces the statutory distinction between share capital and debt, asserting that preference shareholders are investors, not lenders, and their claims for redemption cannot constitute a \"financial debt\" to trigger insolvency proceedings under Section 7 of the IBC.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute originated from EPC Constructions India Limited (EPCC) converting outstanding receivables of ₹250 crore from Matix Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited into 8% CRPS. When Matix failed to redeem these shares due to a lack of profits or fresh issue proceeds, EPCC's liquidator filed an application under Section 7 of the IBC, contending that Matix had defaulted on a \"financial debt.\" Both the NCLT and NCLAT dismissed this petition, leading to the appeal before the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's analysis highlighted several key points. It affirmed that preference shares constitute part of a company's share capital under the Companies Act, 2013, and do not represent loans. Therefore, even if redemption is due, failure to redeem does not transform shareholders into creditors. The Court emphasized that redemption under Section 55 of the Companies Act is contingent upon the availability of distributable profits or proceeds from a fresh issue of shares, which Matix lacked. Furthermore, the conversion of receivables into shares extinguished the original debt, making it a conscious equity investment rather than a disguised loan. The Court also rejected arguments based on accounting treatment classifying CRPS as \"unsecured loans,\" stating that accounting standards cannot override the legal nature of a transaction. Finally, it clarified that the \"commercial effect of borrowing\" test under Section 5(8)(f) of the IBC applies only to genuine debt transactions involving the disbursal and time value of money, which equity instruments like CRPS inherently lack.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling by the Supreme Court critically reinforces the distinction between equity and debt within corporate finance. It safeguards the IBC from being invoked as a mechanism for recovering equity investments and underscores that share capital retains its equity character until lawfully redeemed in accordance with the Companies Act. The judgment contributes to strengthening corporate governance by promoting investor discipline and preserving the integrity of corporate capital structures.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court has issued an ex-parte ad-interim injunction in favor of Crocs Inc. and its subsidiary, affirming the protection of their extensive intellectual property rights against Sagar Doijode, trading as Questsole, and others. The suit, filed before the Delhi High Court, sought a permanent injunction for alleged infringement of Crocs' patents, trademarks, registered designs, and distinctive trade dress.</p>\n\n<p>Crocs alleged that Questsole was manufacturing, advertising, and selling footwear and shoe charms that were identical or deceptively similar to their products. Specifically, the defendants were accused of infringing Patent No. IN 271337, which covers the system for attaching decorative accessories (Jibbitz) to shoes, and of copying the registered design No. 349374-001 for Crocs' iconic clog-style footwear. Furthermore, Questsole was found to be using deceptive marks like “CROCKS,” “CROC,” and “JIBIT,” infringing Crocs' registered trademarks “CROCS” and “JIBBITZ.” The defendants also imitated Crocs’ distinctive trade dress, characterized by the clogs' unique bulbous shape, ventilation holes, and back strap design, and posted disparaging videos online.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Tejas Karia, after reviewing the evidence, determined that Crocs Inc. possessed substantial global goodwill, reputation, and valid intellectual property registrations. The Court observed that the defendants' actions, including the use of deceptively similar marks and designs, appeared to be a dishonest attempt to exploit Crocs’ established brand identity and create consumer confusion. A test purchase confirmed direct patent infringement, and the visual and structural resemblance between the defendants' products and Crocs' registered design and trade dress was deemed fraudulent imitation, leading to dilution of Crocs’ distinctiveness.</p>\n\n<p>Based on these findings, the Delhi High Court concluded that Crocs Inc. had established a prima facie case for interim relief, with the balance of convenience lying in its favor and a risk of irreparable harm if an injunction was not granted. Consequently, the Court restrained the defendants from using the infringing marks, manufacturing or selling products embodying Crocs' patented system, imitating its registered design, or copying the distinctive trade dress of Crocs’ geometric clogs. The matter is scheduled for further hearing on February 16, 2026.</p>",

    "title": "Concealment of Free Seats Amounts to Unfair Trade Practice: Maharashtra Commission Finds Emirates Airlines Deficient in Service",
    "description": "<p>The Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Mumbai, has ruled that Emirates Airlines engaged in deficiency of service and unfair trade practice by misleading passengers into paying for seat selection when free adjacent seats were available. This significant decision, stemming from the case of Emirates Airlines v. Dr. Keshab Nandy & Anr., upheld a District Forum's order compelling the airline to refund ₹7,200 with interest and provide compensation for mental agony and litigation costs. Notably, the ruling is one of the first judicial recognitions in India of \"dark patterns\"—deceptive online design practices that manipulate consumer choice—within consumer jurisprudence, highlighting a growing emphasis on transparency in digital consumer interactions.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Dr. Keshab Nandy, a diabetic and hypertension patient, and his wife, Mrs. Meenu Pandey, who pre-booked adjacent seats online for ₹7,200 for a Mumbai-New York flight in 2017 to ensure Dr. Nandy received assistance. Upon arrival at the airport, they discovered numerous free adjacent seats that other passengers had availed without charge. This led them to allege that Emirates had falsely led them to believe paid pre-booking was the only option for guaranteed adjacent seating, constituting a deficiency in service and unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.</p>\n\n<p>Emirates Airlines contended that seat selection was an optional, voluntary, and non-refundable service, and that free selection was available 48 hours before departure. However, the Commission rejected this argument, finding that Emirates failed to disclose crucial information regarding the availability of free adjacent seats. It emphasized that the airline's online interface created a false impression of scarcity and compelled passengers like the complainants to make unnecessary payments, thereby violating the principles of transparency and informed consent.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the State Commission dismissed Emirates' appeal, affirming the District Forum's directive for a refund of ₹7,200 with 9% interest from the complaint date, ₹10,000 for mental agony, and ₹10,000 for litigation costs. This ruling is a progressive affirmation of consumer rights in the digital age, expanding the scope of unfair trade practices to encompass manipulative online design and the omission of key information. It sends a clear message to airlines and digital service providers about the importance of transparency and fairness in all consumer interactions, both online and offline, to prevent consumer exploitation.</p>",

    "title": "Security Cheques vs. Enforceable Debt: Delhi High Court Reiterates Limits of Section 138 NI Act",
    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court, in the case of Sri Sai Sapthagiri Sponge Pvt. Ltd. v. State (GNCT of Delhi) & Anr., has delivered a significant judgment clarifying the boundaries of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The Court quashed multiple complaints, reiterating that cheques issued merely as security or for audit purposes do not constitute instruments issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt, and thus do not attract criminal liability under the Act. The ruling also addressed critical jurisdictional and procedural flaws in the handling of cheque dishonour cases.</p>\n\n<p>A central point of the judgment was the distinction between security cheques and those issued for existing debt. The Court found that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) explicitly stated the cheques were issued \"for security purpose only\" and \"not for depositing into bank.\" This contractual clarity was pivotal, leading the Court to conclude that such cheques could not be treated as having been issued in satisfaction of a legally recoverable debt or liability, which is a prerequisite for invoking Section 138 NI Act.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the High Court highlighted a significant jurisdictional error. The original complaints were filed in Bellary but later returned due to a lack of territorial jurisdiction, aligning with the Supreme Court's ruling in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod. Subsequently, when the complaints were refiled in New Delhi, the Metropolitan Magistrate adopted the summoning orders previously issued by the Bellary court, instead of issuing fresh summons after due application of mind. The Court held that any proceedings, including summoning orders, conducted by a court lacking jurisdiction are \"non-est in law,\" rendering the adopted orders and all subsequent proceedings null and void.</p>\n\n<p>This decision from the Delhi High Court reinforces two critical legal principles: it safeguards businesses by clarifying that security cheques, when demonstrably not for a present debt, cannot lead to criminal liability under Section 138 NI Act; and it stresses the fundamental importance of procedural propriety and strict adherence to territorial jurisdiction in judicial proceedings. The judgment thereby strengthens the balance between commercial accountability and procedural fairness, preventing the criminalization of civil disputes in cheque transactions.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India overturned a Calcutta High Court order, clarifying that industrial and commercial entities cannot seek restoration of acquired land under judicial directions intended for dispossessed farmers. The ruling emphasizes that the relief granted in Kedar Nath Yadav v. State of West Bengal, which restored land to cultivators, was a socially remedial measure to protect vulnerable agricultural communities displaced by state acquisition, and should not be extended to industrial undertakings.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from the Singur Project, where the West Bengal government acquired land for Tata Motors' Nano plant, including land owned by M/s Santi Ceramics Pvt. Ltd. Santi Ceramics accepted compensation for its land but later sought restoration based on the Kedar Nath Yadav ruling, which quashed the acquisition. While the High Court allowed the petition, the Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that the remedy in Kedar Nath Yadav was specifically for disadvantaged farmers and not for commercial entities.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Santi Ceramics but granted limited relief regarding its factory structures and machinery. This judgment reinforces that judicial directions aimed at protecting vulnerable sections cannot be expanded to include commercial entities that benefited from the acquisition process. It underscores the distinction between public welfare remedies and private commercial claims, while upholding principles of waiver, estoppel, and finality in acquisition proceedings.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Greenhouse Gases Emission Intensity Target Rules, 2025, introduced by the Indian government, aim to curb greenhouse gas emissions across key industrial sectors. Aligned with frameworks like the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, these rules enforce emission reduction targets by focusing on emission intensity, promoting efficiency improvements without hindering economic growth. The rules provide comprehensive definitions, including terms like \"banked\" carbon credits, \"compliance year,\" and specific measurements for \"greenhouse gases emission intensity targets.\" Definitions also reference related legislation like the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023, ensuring consistency across environmental policies.</p>\n\n<p>The rules establish specific emission intensity targets for sectors like Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, and Pulp and Paper. These targets, outlined in the Schedule, provide a trajectory for emission intensity reductions. For instance, entities in the Aluminium sector face baseline GHG emission intensities with specific reduction targets for subsequent years. This structured approach fosters accountability and progress tracking.</p>\n\n<p>Obligated entities must achieve the emission intensity targets specified in the Schedule. Shortfalls require entities to surrender banked carbon credit certificates or purchase new ones. Registration on the designated portal under the Indian Carbon Market Framework and submission of required documentation are also mandatory. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency manages the issuance of carbon credit certificates, providing an incentive for emission reductions. The number of certificates issued is based on the difference between achieved and target emission intensities, multiplied by production units. Entities can bank these certificates for future use.</p>\n\n<p>Environmental compensation is imposed on obligated entities failing to meet the requirements. The Central Pollution Control Board sets the compensation at twice the average price of carbon credit certificates traded during the relevant compliance year's trading cycle. Payment must be made within 90 days, with additional penalties under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 for non-compliance. Collected funds are used for initiatives aligned with the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Greenhouse Gases Emission Intensity Target Rules, 2025, offer a framework for reducing emissions in India, balancing regulatory stringency with practical implementation. Effective enforcement and stakeholder collaboration are critical to achieving national and international environmental goals.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in M/s Godwin Construction Pvt. Ltd. v. Commissioner, Meerut Division & Anr., clarified the classification of instruments for stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. The Court ruled that when a party executes a deed to secure its own obligations, it is classified as a mortgage deed under Article 40, regardless of being titled a \"Security Bond cum Mortgage Deed.\" This is based on the principle that the substance of the transaction prevails over its form.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a dispute where M/s Godwin Construction Pvt. Ltd. executed a \"Security Bond cum Mortgage Deed\" to the Meerut Development Authority (MDA) to secure development obligations, paying stamp duty under the \"Security Bond\" category. Authorities later deemed it a mortgage deed, demanding additional stamp duty. The Supreme Court, upholding lower court decisions, emphasized that Article 57 (Security Bond) applies only when a third-party surety guarantees another's obligations, as per Section 126 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Because the developer mortgaged its own property and no surety was involved, Article 40 (Mortgage Deed) was deemed applicable.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment reinforces that the true legal character of a document is determined by its operative terms and recitals, not merely its title. Where a party mortgages their own property to secure obligations, it constitutes a mortgage deed. This ruling offers clarity for developers, lenders, and authorities, minimizing ambiguity and ensuring consistent stamp duty assessment in real estate and financing transactions. It also underscores the importance of precise legal language in security documents to avoid future disputes.</p>",

Union of India & Ors., has issued a significant directive compelling the Central Government and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to promptly frame and notify regulations for genetically modified (GM) foods under Section 22 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The Court emphasized that the current absence of such regulations constitutes a regulatory vacuum, posing substantial risks to public health and infringing upon the fundamental right to life and health guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling emerged from a Public Interest Litigation highlighting the unregulated sale, import, and distribution of GM food products in India, particularly edible oils like soybean and canola, without requisite scientific evaluation of their health impacts. Petitioners argued that despite the FSS Act mandating a framework, FSSAI had failed to establish regulations, allowing GM ingredients into the market without proper oversight or safety standards. The petition also challenged the legality of merely labelling GM products under existing rules without a fundamental regulatory approval process.</p>\n\n<p>The Court underscored the State's affirmative duty under Article 47 to ensure safe nutrition, asserting that food security cannot undermine food safety. It invoked the precautionary principle, stressing that potential harm from unregulated GM foods necessitates robust oversight. Key findings included that the absence of regulations directly violates Article 21, that FSSAI is the sole competent authority for GM food regulation, and that consumers possess a fundamental right to know about GM ingredients in their food. The Court also deemed any prior approvals by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) for GM foods as illegal and non-binding.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the Rajasthan High Court directed FSSAI to finalize and notify the GM food regulations within three months. Furthermore, it mandated that no GM food product, whether raw, processed, or as an ingredient, should be imported, manufactured, or sold in India without FSSAI approval and compliance with the new regulations, including specific labelling requirements. The judgment reinforces that food safety is a constitutional imperative deeply connected to human dignity, urging proactive governance to align scientific advancement with public welfare and constitutional values.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court, in the case of Naveen Kumar v. Babita Jain, has issued a significant ruling affirming that a housewife who owns a tenanted property can legitimately seek eviction of a tenant if the premises are required for her husband's welfare or to enable him to start a business. This decision clarifies that familial obligations and spousal dependence fall within the ambit of \"for his own use\" as defined under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, emphasizing the gender-neutral application of rent control laws.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose when Mrs. Babita Jain, the landlady and a housewife, filed an eviction petition seeking possession of a tenanted shop for her husband to commence a dry-fruits business. The Additional Rent Controller granted the eviction, prompting the tenant to appeal to the Delhi High Court. The tenant argued that the landlady, as a housewife without an independent income, could not claim eviction for her husband's benefit and that the asserted need was fabricated.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court rejected the tenant's contentions, affirming that gender or occupation is immaterial in determining a bona-fide need. Citing the Supreme Court's judgment in Joginder Pal v. Naval Kishore Behal, the Court reiterated that \"for his own use\" must be interpreted liberally to include dependent family members. It held that a housewife possesses equal rights to seek eviction for the welfare or livelihood of her dependents, and to interpret the statute otherwise would amount to discrimination, violating Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution. The Court found the landlady's claim genuine, noting the tenant's failure to provide evidence disproving the need or showing the husband's alternative employment.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Court upheld the Additional Rent Controller's finding that the landlady's need for the premises for her husband's business was genuine and bona fide. It dismissed the tenant's revision petition and recorded the tenant's undertaking to vacate the premises by May 30, 2026. This judgment underscores that familial welfare and economic dignity are central to the concept of bona-fide requirement, harmonizing the Delhi Rent Control Act with constitutional principles of gender neutrality and reinforcing that ownership rights and legal entitlements are independent of economic participation or employment status.</p>",

Indian Bank & Ors. affirmed that borrowers or guarantors do not possess a right to demand a One-Time Settlement (OTS), nor can courts compel banks to disclose internal settlement benchmarks or accept settlement proposals. The Court emphasized that loan recovery and settlement decisions fall squarely within the commercial wisdom of banks, which manage public funds and are bound by financial discipline. Judicial intervention under Article 226 of the Constitution is unwarranted, particularly when statutory remedies under the SARFAESI Act, 2002, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), are available.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Ms. Archana Wani, a guarantor for a defaulted loan of ₹62 crore, whose account was declared a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). After the bank initiated recovery proceedings under SARFAESI and IBC, Ms. Wani submitted multiple OTS proposals. These were rejected by the bank for not meeting its \"benchmark criteria,\" which the petitioner argued were arbitrarily withheld. She sought judicial intervention to compel the bank to disclose its standards and accept her proposal.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court meticulously reviewed the contractual obligations and statutory frameworks, concluding that a bank's decision on an OTS proposal is a purely commercial one based on internal policies and risk assessment. The Court reiterated that an OTS proposal does not confer any enforceable right upon the borrower, and banks are not statutorily obligated to disclose their internal benchmark parameters. Relying on established Supreme Court precedents, the Bench highlighted that compelling banks to settle on terms dictated by borrowers would undermine financial prudence and public interest. Consequently, the High Court dismissed the petition, reiterating that OTS schemes are discretionary concessions, not enforceable rights, and that negotiation, not entitlement, is the pathway to settlement. The interim stay on recovery was, however, continued for six weeks to allow the petitioner to explore alternate remedies.</p>",

While \"irretrievable breakdown of marriage\" is not a statutory ground for divorce, the court acknowledged that prolonged separation and loss of trust, in conjunction with demonstrated cruelty, support the dissolution of marriage. The judgment serves as a significant precedent, urging courts to recognize the psychological impact of relentless litigation and ensuring that legal remedies are not weaponized for personal vendettas within matrimonial disputes.</p>",

Effective immediately and applicable to all entities—private and public—possessing radiating hardware under WPC licenses, these stern guidelines establish clear accountability and strict timelines for equipment disposal, backed by the threat of prosecution under the Indian Telegraphy Act.</p>\n\n<p>The guidelines prescribe varying disposal periods depending on the manner of licence expiry. For licensee-initiated cancellations, a 90-day window is provided to scrap, return, transfer the apparatus, or secure a Non-Destructive Possession Licence (NDPL), with a \"deemed NDPL\" cover during this period. In cases of simple non-renewal, a 30-day period is allotted for disposal, requiring a disposal certificate upload within seven days of completion, also with a deemed NDPL. The most abrupt scenario, government-induced termination due to breach of conditions, allows only 15 days for hardware removal and surrender, reflecting a heightened focus on spectrum security. Retaining equipment for future experiments necessitates obtaining a regular NDPL before the existing licence lapses, as no deemed grace period is extended for long-term storage.</p>\n\n<p>Proof of disposal can be established by returning equipment to the original vendor or an authorised dealer, transferring it to another licensed entity with identical frequency clearance, or physically destroying it in the presence of a Wireless Monitoring Organisation (WMO) inspector or licensed dealer. Government laboratories may self-certify demolition but must inform WPC. Crucially, all disposed equipment, including circuit boards, batteries, and metal carcasses, must comply with the Environment Ministry's 2022 rules for telecom-specific e-waste, ensuring they reach only authorised recyclers.</p>\n\n<p>Non-compliance with these new directives will be treated as a wilful violation, leading to \"appropriate action\" by the DoT, which could include fines, black-listing, and criminal prosecution under wireless statutes. The new playbook definitively shifts the full lifecycle liability for every radio chip onto the licence-holder, emphasizing that experimental frequencies are temporary leases on public property, and equipment must be promptly removed once the licence tenure concludes.</p>",

The court acknowledged the conflict between recognizing the rights of tribal communities to adequate housing and the need to preserve forest ecology.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a dispute over whether forest dwellers could construct permanent homes on forest land without violating the FCA. Petitioners argued the FRA grants habitation rights, including durable housing, while the Union of India emphasized the FCA's role in forest preservation. The core legal issue was whether FRA-recognized construction could proceed despite FCA regulations.</p>\n\n<p>The Court analyzed both Acts, noting the FRA's limited \"notwithstanding\" clause doesn't explicitly authorize housing construction without FCA oversight. It reaffirmed that the FCA regulates, rather than prohibits, non-forest activities, emphasizing forest protection as a constitutional obligation.

    "description": "<p>A protracted legal battle spanning over two decades, stemming from a 2004 tractor accident, recently concluded with a significant judgment by the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The case centered on the New India Insurance Company's liability when an agricultural tractor, insured solely for farming purposes, was involved in an accident while transporting wedding guests (Baratis), resulting in injuries to two pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>The incident occurred on May 29, 2004, when a speeding tractor collided with Shivram Chaudhary and Sukhlal Chaudhary, causing various injuries. The 3rd Additional Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal initially awarded compensation of ₹30,000 to Shivram and ₹10,000 to Sukhlal, directing the insurer to pay with the liberty to recover the amount from the vehicle's owner and driver (a \"pay and recover\" order).</p>\n\n<p>Aggrieved by the tribunal's decision, three appeals were filed: Shivram Chaudhary sought enhanced compensation, while the insurance company challenged its liability entirely. The insurer argued a fundamental breach of policy terms, citing that the tractor, insured for agricultural use, was illegally transporting passengers. Furthermore, the driver allegedly lacked a valid license. The claimants contended the awarded compensation was insufficient given their sustained injuries and economic losses.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court, after meticulous examination, sided with the insurance company. It emphasized that the tractor's use for carrying wedding guests constituted a clear and fundamental deviation from its insured purpose, altering the risk profile significantly. Citing Supreme Court precedents, the court affirmed that insurers are not liable when vehicles are used in direct violation of core policy conditions, particularly when carrying unauthorized passengers. Consequently, the \"pay and recover\" doctrine was deemed inapplicable in this instance due to the deliberate and fundamental nature of the policy breach.</p>\n\n<p>While exonerating the insurance company, the High Court acknowledged the inadequacy of Shivram Chaudhary's original compensation. It enhanced his award to ₹50,000, factoring in his physical pain, medical expenses, and long-term impact on his livelihood. The final judgment directed the owner and driver of the tractor to jointly and severally deposit the full compensation amount, including the enhanced sum and interest, within 30 days. The insurance company was relieved of all liability, with provisions for refunding any amounts already deposited and recovering any sums paid to the claimant from the owner and driver.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court has affirmed the preferential right of family members to purchase ancestral property, particularly when it remains undivided, even if the selling co-parcener transfers their share to an outsider. This significant ruling arose from a dispute involving ancestral agricultural lands in Beed district, Maharashtra, where certain members of a joint Hindu family (Rathod family) sold portions of undivided property to external purchasers without offering it to the other co-parceners (Selukar family). The plaintiffs, the Selukar family, invoked Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, to assert their right of pre-emption, a claim previously upheld by the Trial Court.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Shailesh P. Brahme's analysis established that the properties were indeed undivided joint family holdings, confirming the plaintiffs and the original sellers as co-parceners. The Court clarified that while Section 22 specifically references Class I heirs, in the context of undivided joint family property, the right of pre-emption extends to all co-parceners sharing a common ancestral interest. A pivotal aspect of the judgment was the ruling that a separate declaration to set aside the sale deeds was not required; title automatically vests in the plaintiffs upon their deposit of the purchase consideration, as per Order XX Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The High Court also upheld the lower court's decision to extend the payment timeline, recognizing that appellate proceedings had effectively stayed the original decree. Furthermore, the Court rejected the purchasers' reliance on Section 44 of the Transfer of Property Act, as they had not sought partition.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the High Court dismissed both appeals, thereby confirming the concurrent findings of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court. The plaintiffs were directed to deposit the purchase price, along with 6% simple interest, within ninety days. This decision is crucial as it reinforces the pre-emptive rights of co-parceners in undivided ancestral property, streamlining the process by removing the necessity of first canceling sale deeds and providing clarity on the application of Section 22 in such scenarios. It also highlights the judiciary's discretion to adjust timelines for decree execution when appeals delay proceedings.</p>",

Commissioner of Income Tax, clarifying that non-resident companies can be deemed to be carrying on business in India even during periods of operational inactivity, thus remaining eligible for tax deductions and liable for tax on income accruing in India.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Pride Foramer S.A., a French offshore oil drilling company, which experienced a lull in active contracts between 1993 and 1999. During this interim, despite operating from foreign offices and having no active projects, the company engaged in business correspondence, submitted bids, incurred various business-related expenses, and claimed deductions for these along with unabsorbed depreciation. The Income Tax Department, however, disallowed these claims, asserting that the company had ceased business operations during this inactive period.</p>\n\n<p>Reversing the High Court's decision, the Supreme Court affirmed the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal's view, distinguishing a \"lull\" from a \"cessation\" of business. The Court emphasized that a company's continuous intent and efforts to secure future contracts, such as submitting bids and maintaining business correspondence, demonstrate ongoing operations, irrespective of immediate contract acquisition. Crucially, the Court clarified that the absence of a permanent establishment or conducting business solely through foreign offices does not absolve a non-resident company from tax liability in India if income accrues or arises within the country. Consequently, the Court allowed the deduction of business expenses under Section 37 and permitted the carry-forward of unabsorbed depreciation under Section 32(2) of the Income Tax Act.</p>\n\n<p>This landmark judgment adopts a pragmatic and modern approach to assessing non-resident companies, reinforcing the principle of \"substance over form.\" It establishes that business continuity and entitlement to tax benefits are determined by a company's overarching conduct and intent, rather than merely by active contract periods or physical presence within India, thereby aligning with globalized trade dynamics.</p>",

    "title": "Section 17 or Article 226? Kerala High Court Slams the Door on Writ Route in SARFAESI",
    "description": "<p>The Kerala High Court, through a Division Bench, has unequivocally restated that borrowers cannot bypass the specialized statutory remedy under Section 17 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) by directly filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. This ruling emerged from a case involving a ₹16 lakh business loan from Kerala State Cooperative Bank, where a borrower sought the return of physically possessed mortgaged property on mere part-payment.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose after Jishith Kumar defaulted on a loan, leading the bank to classify his account as an NPA and subsequently take physical possession of the mortgaged property under Sections 13 and 14 of the SARFAESI Act. Despite having previously failed to honor a One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme facilitated by an earlier writ petition, the borrower filed a fresh writ, seeking restructuring and immediate release of the asset. A Single Judge initially directed the bank to return possession upon a payment of ₹4 lakh and an instalment plan, which the bank contested as exceeding judicial authority.</p>\n\n<p>The Division Bench, hearing the bank's appeal, meticulously examined the SARFAESI framework and numerous Supreme Court precedents. It concluded that the Single Judge's order effectively rewrote the contract and statute, and that the High Court, exercising writ jurisdiction, could not sit in appeal over a meticulously followed statutory process. The bench emphasized that the proper and sole avenue for the borrower to challenge the bank's actions after possession was taken was under Section 17 before the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT). It dismissed the argument that a bank's informal concession could override substantive statutory rights, affirming that equity follows the law.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the Division Bench set aside the Single Judge's judgment in its entirety and dismissed the writ petition as not maintainable. While reaffirming the judiciary's role in policing its own boundaries and prioritizing statutory discipline over judicial equity, the court clarified that its order does not prevent the borrower from approaching the DRT under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. This decision serves as a critical reminder for borrowers that the High Court is not the first forum for challenging SARFAESI proceedings, reinforcing the legislative intent of swift, non-interventionist recovery mechanisms for financial institutions.</p>",

    "title": "Dependents Beyond Legal Heirs Entitled to Compensation: MP High Court",
    "description": "<p>The Madhya Pradesh High Court, in a landmark decision in Smt. Saroj & Others v. Rajendra Prasad Patel & Others, significantly broadened the interpretation of \"legal representative\" under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The case addressed whether individuals not strictly legal heirs, but demonstrably financially and emotionally dependent on the deceased, are entitled to compensation for a motor accident death. The High Court adopted a liberal and humanitarian approach, emphasizing that the Act is beneficial legislation designed to provide relief to victims and their dependents, transcending the technicalities of personal law.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a motor accident where Ramakant Patel died. His brother's widow, Smt. Saroj, and her daughter filed a claim, asserting that Ramakant had supported them financially and emotionally after her husband's demise. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal rejected their claim, holding that as they were not legally wedded wife or biological child, they could not be legal heirs. However, the High Court overturned this, referencing the Supreme Court's ruling in N. Jayasree v. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Co. Ltd., which states that \"legal representative\" is not confined to legal heirs but includes anyone demonstrating financial dependency, even without a formal marital relationship.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed that evidence clearly showed the deceased supported Smt. Saroj and her daughter, thus qualifying them as dependents and \"legal representatives\" under Section 166 of the Act. This judgment marks a progressive development in accident compensation jurisprudence, acknowledging the evolving social realities where dependency and familial bonds may extend beyond conventional definitions of marriage or heirship. It underscores that substantive justice should prioritize proven dependency and loss over rigid adherence to formal relationships, ensuring the compassionate intent of the Motor Vehicles Act is upheld.</p>",

    "title": "Arms Act, 1959: Renewal is the Norm, Refusal the Exception, Rules Madras High Court",
    "description": "<p>The Madras High Court, in a significant ruling by its Madurai Bench, has clarified that while possessing a firearm is a regulated privilege under the Arms Act, 1959, the renewal of an existing licence, especially after peaceful use, should be considered the norm. Refusal of renewal, the Court asserted, must be based on explicit, rational, and case-specific findings, shifting the burden from the applicant to the licensing authority to provide compelling reasons.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment arose from a petition filed by Magudapathi, an ordinary citizen who held a smooth bore gun licence since 2021 for crop protection and sport, which had been routinely renewed once. His application for a second renewal in 2024 was denied by the District Magistrate cum District Collector, Dindigul, solely on the grounds that Magudapathi was facing prosecution under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code for a fatal motor vehicle accident. The Collector deemed this a threat to \"public safety,\" prompting Magudapathi to challenge the decision in the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>Justice G.R. Swaminathan, examining Sections 13, 14, and 15 of the Arms Act, 1959, highlighted Section 15(3), which mandates that a licence \"shall, unless the licensing authority for reasons to be recorded in writing otherwise decides, be renewable.\" The Court emphasized that this provision converts the initial privilege into an expectancy of renewal, which can only be defeated by reasons that meet the standards of Section 14, pertaining to refusal. The High Court found the Collector's justification \"woefully insufficient,\" stating that a prosecution for negligent driving (Section 304A IPC) is distinct from firearm-related misconduct, nor does it indicate an individual is of unsound mind or unfit as per Section 14. Furthermore, the Court reiterated that while alternative remedies exist, it can intervene via writ jurisdiction when an impugned order is patently illegal.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the High Court quashed the Collector's order and directed the renewal of Magudapathi’s gun licence for five years, subject to standard conditions. This ruling serves as a crucial reminder that administrative discretion in weapon licensing tightens once a citizen has demonstrated trustworthy conduct, safeguarding individual expectation and ensuring a principled application of the Arms Act against arbitrary denials based on unrelated criminal proceedings.</p>",

    "title": "Rajasthan HC: Assignment under section 5 SARFAESI survives even if NPA tag quashed, guarantors can’t reopen decade-old ARC deal.",
    "description": "<p>The Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur Bench, recently delivered a significant ruling affirming that a debt assignment under Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, maintains its validity even if the Non-Performing Asset (NPA) classification, which triggered subsequent enforcement actions, is later quashed. In Harendra Singh Rathore & Ors. v. State Bank of India & Ors., Justice Rekha Borana refused to undo a 2014 debt assignment by SBI to Alchemist Assets Reconstruction Co., emphasizing that invalidating the NPA tag affects only Section 13 enforcement actions, not the independent prior sale of the loan under Section 5.</p>\n\n<p>This decade-long legal battle originated from a ₹24 crore debt incurred by Hotel Gaudavan Pvt. Ltd. in 2008, guaranteed by its director-shareholders. After the account became an NPA and was put up for sale, SBI assigned the debt to Alchemist ARC in 2014. Despite borrowers' attempts to challenge the proceedings through various forums, including a DRT ruling in 2015 that declared the original NPA classification illegal, the debt's ownership remained with the ARC. The guarantors subsequently sought to declare the 2014 assignment void, arguing that the quashing of the NPA rendered all subsequent actions, including the assignment, invalid.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court dismissed the guarantors' petition, primarily citing the principle of res judicata, as identical pleas had been rejected multiple times by various judicial bodies, up to the Supreme Court. The court reiterated that while Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act requires an NPA declaration for enforcement, Section 5, which deals with the transfer of financial assets, does not. Therefore, the 2015 DRT order invalidating the NPA only impacted possession proceedings, not the earlier, distinct assignment deed. Relying on the Supreme Court's ICICI Bank v. Official Liquidator of APS Star Industries judgment, the court affirmed that a debt is an asset transferable by a bank without borrower consent, irrespective of the NPA tag's correctness. The court also noted the availability of alternative statutory remedies for challenging recovery orders.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling provides crucial clarity and reassurance for lenders and Asset Reconstruction Companies. It firmly establishes that a bank's right to assign its loan under Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act is an independent power, not contingent on the ultimate fate of its internal NPA classification or the successful execution of Section 13 enforcement measures. Once a debt is assigned, courts will generally uphold the finality of that contract, strengthening the framework for managing and resolving bad assets within the financial system.</p>",

    "title": "IBC and Homebuyers Protection",
    "description": "<p>The article details the evolving landscape of homebuyers' rights under India's Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). A pivotal 2018 amendment recognized real estate allottees as financial creditors, granting them participation and voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) during Corporate Insolvency Resolution Processes (CIRP). This move followed significant protests by homebuyers, who were initially excluded from meaningful engagement, leading to earlier regulatory adjustments by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to facilitate their claims. Courts have consistently held that delays in property handover constitute a default under the IBC, necessitating developers to either deliver or return funds.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this progress, the Supreme Court's validation of the 2018 amendment in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. v. Union of India (2019) categorized homebuyers as unsecured creditors. This classification has been criticized for limiting their recovery prospects and decision-making power in comparison to secured financial institutions, which typically dominate the CoC. Practical administration reveals ongoing inequities, including the exclusion of homebuyers who fail to file claims on time and a significant disparity in interest rates, with homebuyers receiving a capped 8% per annum while lenders impose much higher rates. Regulatory measures, such as IBBI's Regulation 4-E, further empower project lenders by requiring substantial CoC approval for possession, potentially exacerbating homebuyer suppression.</p>\n\n<p>The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), 2016, complements the IBC by mandating transparency, timely project completion, and offering recourse for delays. However, a deeper integration of these frameworks is needed. Legal scholarship and emerging jurisprudence advocate for elevating homebuyers to secured creditor status, citing their proprietary interest in specific flats and the statutory debt arising from non-delivery under RERA. While innovative judicial solutions like 'Reverse CIRP' have emerged to protect possession rights, a definitive consensus on granting homebuyers secured status remains elusive.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends from 2023-2025 indicate some positive shifts, with the Supreme Court acknowledging verified claims for flat possession and urging the inclusion of unfiled but recorded claims. Nevertheless, systemic challenges persist, fueled by fragmented homebuyer groups, procedural complexities, opaque valuations, and the financial dominance of project lenders. Comprehensive reforms are crucial, including enhancing homebuyers' voting power, legally recognizing their secured status, equalizing interest rates, and empowering regulators to enforce transparency and penalize malfeasance, ultimately ensuring homebuyers' constitutional right to shelter is effectively upheld within the insolvency framework.</p>",

    "title": "Orissa HC slams Cuttack bank for holding back gratuity over a loan guarantee—reaffirms Section 4(6) is the only key to forfeit gratuity dues.",
    "description": "<p>The Orissa High Court, in a Division Bench ruling on September 20, 2025, emphatically reiterated that gratuity can only be forfeited under the precise conditions stipulated in Section 4(6) of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The court admonished the Cuttack Central Cooperative Bank Ltd. for unlawfully withholding a retired employee's gratuity over her role as a personal guarantor for a defaulted loan, underscoring that superannuation does not permit such set-offs.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when a Deputy Manager, who retired in 2010 after superannuation with an unblemished record, was denied her gratuity. The bank justified its action by citing her liability as a guarantor for a loan that later went unpaid. This decision was consistently overturned by the Controlling Authority, the Appellate Authority, and a Single Bench of the Orissa High Court before reaching the Division Bench as a writ appeal.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court dismissed the bank's appeal, emphasizing that Section 4(6) of the Act, which begins with a non-obstante clause, permits forfeiture only to the extent of damage or loss suffered by the employer if the employee was \"terminated\" for a wilful act, omission, or negligence causing such damage. Retirement on superannuation, the court clarified, is the antithesis of termination for misconduct, thus eliminating the statutory trigger for forfeiture. The court further held that introducing a guarantor's civil liability into the Act would constitute an unauthorized judicial expansion of its scope, reinforcing that gratuity is a statutory right earned through service, not a security deposit for credit.</p>\n\n<p>Concluding that three statutory forums had already reached the same conclusion without perversity, irrationality, or exceeding statutory remit, the court found no grounds for interference. This judgment serves as a critical reminder to all employers that the provisions of Section 4(6) of the 1972 Act are the sole gateway for gratuity forfeiture, strictly limited to proven misconduct and not extendable to civil liabilities like loan guarantees. The bank was consequently ordered to release the gratuity forthwith.</p>",
